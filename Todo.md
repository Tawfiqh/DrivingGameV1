TODO List 
=========

Basic game
----------
1. ✅ Basic run loop - updating game state and rendering
2. ✅ Basic game = car drives along - can steer left and right and forward
3. ✅ Draw a road - and a car - and keep the car on the road
4. ✅ Populate trees off-the road
5. ✅ Move to Typescript
6. Collision detection if it's off-road => crash = end the game
7. Scoring based on displacement from start-point
8. Vehicles on the road



3d Rendering
-------------
1. 3d rednering that follows the car


Game mechanics
-------------
1. Handle crashes and collisions a bit better -- e.g: reset to the middle of the road with zero velocity OR wipeout completely depending on speed, i.e slow is fine, fast is game-over
